# Hi there! I'm Iwan :construction_worker_man:

A beginner analyst based in Jakarta. I enjoy learning something new, also like reading books and sports. Occasionally, publish posts [here](https://medium.com/@kurniawan50).

Presently working as a Support Analyst at Telkom Indonesia. In my daily job, I do a lot of simple analytics to determine sales performance. From the start of a professional career, many jobs are related to data and analysis.

Accomplished bachelor in Industrial Engineering from [UPN "Veteran" Jakarta](https://www.upnvj.ac.id/). The thing I like is learning to think and shape logic, which is highly useful in a professional career.

I speak English, Indonesian and Javanese (mother tongue), but very professional in Google Translate. I will enjoy connecting with you, feel free to add my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iwankurniawan50/).
